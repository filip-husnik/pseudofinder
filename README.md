## Introduction

Pseudofinder is a Python3 script that detects pseudogene candidates [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogene] from annotated genbank files of bacterial and archaeal genomes.

It was tested mostly on genbank (.gbf/.gbk) files annotated by Prokka [https://github.com/tseemann/prokka] with the --compliant flag (i.e. including both /gene and /CDS annotations).

There are alternative programs for pseudogene finding and annotation (e.g. the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/]), but to the best of our knowledge, none of them is open source and allows fine-tuning of parameters.


## Getting started

These instructions will (hopefully) get you the pipeline up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Installation requirements: 
- python3
- pip3 (or any other way how to install python libraries, e.g. conda or easy_install)
- biopython
- ncbi-blast+
- Databases: NCBI-NR (non-redundant) protein database (or similar such as SwissProt) formatted for blastP/blastX searches.
- An annotated prokaryotic genome in genbank (.gbf/.gbk) format.

### Installation

A step by step series of commands to install all system dependencies:

<b>Installation of python3, pip3, git (optional), and ncbi-blast+ on Ubuntu (as an administrator):</b>
```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3

```

### Test run

## Preparing your genome

### Assembly recommendations

We recommend several rounds of Pilon polishing with Illumina reads to improve your consensus sequence [https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon/wiki], particularly if you're interested to find pseudogenes in minION/PacBio assemblies. However, Pseudofinder can also help with finding sequencing/basecalling errors potentially breaking genes in MinION/PacBio-only assemblies.

Genomes closed into one or several circular-mapping molecules (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages) should be ideally oriented based on their origin of replication [e.g. by Ori-Finder 2; http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Ori-Finder2/] to avoid broken genes on contigs randomly linearized by the genome assembler.

### Annotation recommendations

We recommend genbank (.gbf/.gbk) files generated by Prokka [https://github.com/tseemann/prokka] with the --compliant and --rfam flags. Annotating rRNAs, tRNAs, and other ncRNAs in Prokka is recommended to eliminate any false positive 'pseudogene' candidates. ORFs overlapping with non-coding RNAs such as rRNA can be sometimes misannotated in databases as 'hypothetical proteins'.


```
prokka --compliant --rfam contigs.fa
```

## Commands

### Annotate

TODO: Add a blurb about this command.

As with any other python script, there are two ways how to run it:
```
# Call it directly with python3.
python3 pseudo_finder.py

# Or make the file executable and then rely on its shebang line [#!/usr/bin/env python3].
chmod u+x
./pseudo_finder.py
```

Providing input files:
```
# Run the full pipeline on 16 processors (for BlastX/BlastP searches).
# Unless you have a $BLASTDB environmental variable set on your system, you have to provide a full path to the NR database.
python3 pseudo_finder.py annotate --genome GENOME.GBF --output PREFIX --database /PATH/TO/NR/nr --threads 16 

# Run only pseudogene detection (e.g. when blast output files are already available from a previous run).
python3 pseudo_finder.py annotate --genome GENOME.GBF --output PREFIX --blastp BLASTPFILE.TSV --blastx BLASTX.TSV
```

All command line arguments:
```
Required arguments:
  -g GENOME, --genome GENOME
                        Please provide your genome file in the genbank format.
  -op OUTPREFIX, --outprefix OUTPREFIX
                        Specify an output prefix.

Required arguments if BLAST files are not provided:
  -db DATABASE, --database DATABASE
                        Please provide name (if $BLASTB is set on your system) or absolute path of your blast database.

Required arguments if providing BLAST files:
  -p BLASTP, --blastp BLASTP
                        Specify an input blastp file.
  -x BLASTX, --blastx BLASTX
                        Specify an input blastx file.

Adjustable parameters:
  -of OUTFORMAT, --outformat OUTFORMAT
                        Specifies which style of output to write. Default is 1.
                        See below for explanation.
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Please provide total number of threads to use for blast, default is 4.

  -l LENGTH_PSEUDO, --length_pseudo LENGTH_PSEUDO
                        Please provide percentage of length for pseudo candidates, default is 0.60 (60%). 
                        Example: "-l 0.50" will consider genes that are less than 50% of the average length of similar genes.
  -s SHARED_HITS, --shared_hits SHARED_HITS
                        Percentage of blast hits that must be shared in order to join two nearby regions, default is 0.30 (30%). 
                        Example: "-s 0.50" will merge nearby regions if they shared 50% of their blast hits.
  -e EVALUE, --evalue EVALUE
                        Please provide e-value for blast searches. Default is 1e-4.

  -ce, --contig_ends    Forces the program to include intergenic regions at contig ends. If not specified,
                        the program will ignore any sequence before the first ORF and after the last ORF on a contig.
  -it INTERGENIC_THRESHOLD, --intergenic_threshold INTERGENIC_THRESHOLD
                        Number of BlastX hits needed to annotate an intergenic region as a pseudogene.
                        Calculated as a percentage of maximum number of allowed hits (--hitcap).
                        Default is 0.3.

```

Output of Annotate:

Every run should result in two or more output files: a summary log.txt file and .gff or .faa files.

log.txt: The log file includes basic statistics about pseudogene candidates detected.

Explanation of output choices:

'--outformat 1': GFF file containing only ORFs flagged as pseudogenes.
	The .gff file can be used to overlay the original annotation (we use the Artemis genome browser [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis]) with predicted pseudogene candidates.

'--outformat 2': GFF file containing only ORFs not flagged as pseudogenes. 
	*Currently only contains nucleotide positions, without qualifier information.*

'--outformat 3': FASTA file containing only ORFs flagged as pseudogenes. 
	*Not yet implemented*

'--outformat 4': FAA file containing only ORFs not flagged as pseudogenes.
	This file can be used for any downstream analysis of functional genes. 

*Note: Outputs can be combined. If '-of 12' is specified, files '1' and '2' will be written.


### Visualize

One strength of Pseudofinder is its ability to be fine-tuned to the user's preferences. To help visualize the effects of changing the parameters of this program, we have provided the 'visualize' command. This command will display how many pseudogenes will be detected based on any combination of '--length_pseudo' and '--shared_hits'. It is run by providing the blast files from the 'annotate' command:
```
python pseudo_finder.py visualize \
    --genome GENOME.GBF \
    --blastx BLASTXFILE.TSV \
    --blastp BLASTPFILE.TSV \
    --outprefix PREFIX \
    --hitcap HITCAP
```
Please note: Since the annotation depends on your choice of '--hitcap', you must enter it here. This value can be found in the log file of the run that generated your blast files.


### Map

Pseudofinder can generate a chromosome map to display detected pseudogenes with a single command:

```
pseudo_finder.py map --genome GENOME --gff GFF --outprefix PREFIX
```
Please provide your pseudogene calls in GFF format (the default output from pseudofinder.py annotate).

The resulting chromosome map will show the original annotation in the center track, and pseudogenes will appear on the outer track in red.

## Acknowledgements

This code was inspired mostly by work on bacterial symbionts in early stages of becoming intracellular and strictly host-associated. This ecological shift releases selection pressure ('use it or loose it') on many genes considered essential for free-living bacteria, so relatively recent symbionts can have over 50% of their genes pseudogenized.

## Wish list
There are several additional features we'll try to include in the script in the near future.

1. Include an optional FPKM cut-off when there are RNA-Seq data available.

2. Improve logic for ORFs on contigs ends broken by assembly issues (e.g. metagenome-assembled genomes).

3. Check if the ORFs called as pseudogenes do not represent individual protein domains that can exists and evolve independently of the rest of the original multi-domain protein chain (PFAM?)

4. Include an optional analysis of cryptic pseudogenes based on dN/dS ratios (PAML?...) when there are closely related genomes available.

5. Include DIAMOND blastX and blastP as much faster alternatives to NCBI BlastX and BlastP.

6. Fine tune pseudogene finding for mobile elements such as transposases.

7. Visualize results by a scatter plot of all genes/pseudogenes (dN/dS, GC content, expression, length ratio, ...).

8. Sometimes ORFs are predicted by mistake on the opposite strand (e.g. in GC-rich genomes), check regions with ORFS with no blastP hits by blastX.

Please suggest any additional features here: [https://github.com/filip-husnik/pseudo-finder/issues].
